# odin-recipes

This is the first project under the Odin Project Foundations program, Recipes. 

It is a test of the HTML skills that I have learnt as of 190622.

I have applied the following:

How to fill out the HTML boilerplate
Creation of directories and files
Terminal navigation
Input of Headers, Paragraphs, Images and Links
Creation of unordered and ordered lists
Organise and indent code neatly
(attempt to write good commit messages)
