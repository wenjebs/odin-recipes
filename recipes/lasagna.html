            </li>
            <li>
                While sauce is simmering, blend cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg until smooth. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

                Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
